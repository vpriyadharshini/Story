  produced a two-rupee note and offered it to Binya, indicating that he wanted the
pendant in exchange. Binya put her hand to the necklace, half afraid that the excited
woman would snatch it away from her. Solemnly she shook her head. The man then
showed her a five-rupee note, but again Binya shook her head.
“How silly she is!” exclaimed the young woman.
“It may not be hers to sell,” said the man. “But i’ll try again. How much do you
want—what can we give you?” And he waved his hand towards the picnic things
scattered about on the grass.
Without any hesitation Binya pointed to the umbrella.
“My umbrella!” exclaimed the young woman. “She wants my umbrella. What
cheek!”
“Well, you want her pendant, don’t you?”
“That’s different.”
“Is it?”
The man and his wife were beginning to quarrel with each other.
“I’ll ask her to go away,” said the older woman. “We’re making such fools of
ourselves.”
“But I want the pendant!” cried the other petulantly. And then, on an impulse, she
picked up the umbrella and held it out to Binya. “Here, take the umbrella!”
Binya removed her necklace and held it out to the young woman, who
immediately placed it round her own neck. Then Binya took the umbrella and held it
up. It did not look so small in her hands; in fact, it was just the right size.
She had forgotten about the picnickers, who were busy examining the pendant.
She turned the blue umbrella this way and that; looked through the bright blue silk at
the pulsating sun; and then, still keeping it open, turned and disappeared into the
forest glade.
